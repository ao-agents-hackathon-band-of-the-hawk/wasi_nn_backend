## Backward Compatibility Assurance

All existing code using the current API will continue to work without any changes:
- Existing `test/main.c` will run unchanged
- All current function signatures remain the same
- Old configuration JSON structures still work
- No breaking changes to public interfaces

## Development Approach

This implementation will follow an iterative development process with testing at each step:

1. **Early Validation**: We'll have a working system after Phase 2 that you can test
2. **Incremental Progress**: Each step builds on the previous one with immediate testing
3. **Risk Mitigation**: Issues are caught early before they become complex problems
4. **Collaborative Development**: You can review and provide feedback at each milestone

For each step, I will:
1. Implement the code changes
2. Update the TODO.md to reflect completed work
3. Stop and wait for your review and git commit before proceeding

## Interface Compatibility Principles

1. **Preserve Existing Interfaces**: All current function signatures in wasi_nn_llama.h will remain unchanged
2. **Extend via Configuration**: New functionality will be accessed through enhanced JSON configuration parameters
3. **Backward Compatibility**: Old configuration JSON structures will continue to work
4. **Minimal New APIs**: Only add new functions when absolutely necessary, and only as extensions
